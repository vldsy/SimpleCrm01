Intro

    Install Laravel and Laravel Breeze starter kit

Manage Users

    Change column users.name into separate first_name and last_name
    Use SoftDeletes in all Models
    CRUD for managing users
    Use pagination in this and all other CRUDs
    Seed 10 "fake" users for testing

Introduce Roles

    Install the Spatie Laravel Permission package
    Seed two roles: "admin" and "user"
    Seed one Admin user, Breeze registration should add users with "User" role
    The "Users" CRUD from above should be available only to Admin user

Three More CRUDs

Create three more CRUDs, here are their DB columns:

Clients (all columns are string)

    contact_name
    contact_email
    contact_phone_number
    company_name
    company_address
    company_city
    company_zip
    company_vat

Projects

    title (string)
    description (text)
    user_id (foreign key)
    client_id (foreign key)
    deadline_at (date)
    status: one of the options of 'open', 'in progress', 'blocked', 'cancelled', 'completed'

Tasks

    title (string)
    description (text)
    user_id (foreign key)
    client_id (foreign key)
    project_id (foreign key)
    deadline_at (date)
    status: one of the options of 'open', 'in progress', 'pending', 'waiting client', 'blocked', 'closed'

Create Factories and Seeders for all those tables, seed 20-50 fake records.

Introduce Permissions: The Admin role can manage everything, and the User role can see all entries and create/update them but NOT delete them.
